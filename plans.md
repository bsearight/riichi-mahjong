# Future Plans for the Riichi Mahjong Project

## Short-Term Goals

- ~~Implement tests for all existing modules to ensure code reliability.~~ (Completed)
- Add additional tests for edge cases to patch oversights.
- Finalize the yaku detection module to cover all standard yaku.
- Complete the scoring module to calculate hand scores based on detected yaku.
- Develop a complete progression that utilizes all currently implemented features.
  - eg. input hand, detect validity, calculate yaku, score hand.

## Long-Term Goals

- Explore and implement the Quadtree Algorithm for deficiency calculation.
- Explore and implement the Block Deficiency Algorithm for improved hand analysis.
- Explore and implement the Hierarchical Branch and Bound Algorithm for optimal tile selection.
- Develop a solution that utilizes the above algorithms to create an CPU opponent.
- Consider possible graphical implementations for user interaction. (eg. web app, desktop app)
- Expand documentation to cover all modules and functions comprehensively.
