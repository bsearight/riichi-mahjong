# Future Plans for the Riichi Mahjong Project

## Short-Term Goals

- Implement tests for all existing modules to ensure code reliability.
- Add additional tests for edge cases to patch oversights.
- Complete the scoring module to calculate hand scores based on detected yaku.
- Develop a complete progresssion that utilizes all currently implemented features.
  - eg. input hand, detect validity, calculate yaku, score hand.

## Long-Term Goals

- Determine the credibility of implementing a full game simulation. (No AI players)
- Explore the possibility of implementing the Hierarchical Branch and Bound Algorithm for optimal hand solving. Can be then used for AI players in the future.
- Consider possible graphical implementations for user interaction. (eg. web app, desktop app)
- Refactor codebase to improve modularity and maintainability. (general code cleanup)
- Expand documentation to cover all modules and functions comprehensively.
